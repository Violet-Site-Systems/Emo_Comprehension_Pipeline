# Emotional Comprehension Pipeline

**Mission:** A neuro-symbolic framework for deep emotional comprehension and aligned response generation in AI systems.

## Overview

This repository provides a pipeline for emotional comprehension in AI systems, enabling more empathetic and contextually appropriate responses. The project integrates neuro-symbolic approaches with modern AI architectures to create emotionally aware and aligned AI systems.

## Template Repository

This project is inspired by and builds upon concepts from:
- [Neurodivergent Biocentric Alignment](https://github.com/colleenpridemore/neurodivergent-biocentric-alignment)

## AI Governance & Ethical Licensing

This project is committed to ethical AI development and environmental sustainability through the **BGINEXUS.io AI Commons Licensing Framework**. We incorporate six governance logics for impact-oriented AI licensing:

### The Six AI Governance Commons (BGINEXUS.io)

1. **[Value Commons](LICENSES/VALUE-COMMONS.md)** - Share automation gains with workers, communities, and shared infrastructures
2. **[Transparency Commons](LICENSES/TRANSPARENCY-COMMONS.md)** - Standardize evidence of AI behavior and impacts through reusable documentation
3. **[Sustainability Commons](LICENSES/SUSTAINABILITY-COMMONS.md)** - Embed ecological accounting, energy measurement, and resource constraints
4. **[Access Commons](LICENSES/ACCESS-COMMONS.md)** - Enable meaningful use by public-interest actors, researchers, and underserved communities
5. **[Reciprocity Commons](LICENSES/RECIPROCITY-COMMONS.md)** - Recognize and reward contributions from data creators, annotators, and infrastructure providers
6. **[Governance Commons](LICENSES/GOVERNANCE-COMMONS.md)** - Create multi-stakeholder oversight with real authority over AI systems

These licenses can be adopted **individually or in combination** to operationalize neurodivergent-centered and biocentric values in AI licensing agreements.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file and [LICENSES/](LICENSES/) directory for detailed information.

### Core Framework License

The Emotional Comprehension Pipeline framework itself is released under **CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)** to maximize reuse and benefit for all beings.

### Alignment Principles

- ✅ Neurodivergent-centered design and cognition
- ✅ Biocentric values respecting all forms of life
- ✅ Environmental sustainability and climate justice
- ✅ Transparent and accountable AI development
- ✅ Fair value distribution to all contributors
- ✅ Multi-stakeholder governance and oversight
