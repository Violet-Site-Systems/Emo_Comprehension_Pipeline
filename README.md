# Emotional Comprehension Pipeline

**Mission:** A neuro-symbolic framework for deep emotional comprehension and aligned response generation in AI systems.

## Overview

This repository hosts the **Anshar–Hyperon Pipeline** and its extended architecture for emotionally intelligent, ethically grounded, and scalable systems. It integrates phenomenological translation, neuro-symbolic processing, decentralized governance, and formal scaling constraints, with cross-cutting layers for identity continuity and ethical oversight.

The goal is to create interoperable modules that allow artificial agents and decentralized communities to **comprehend, honor, and align with human emotional nuance**.

## Architecture Layers

The Emotional Comprehension Pipeline is built on six interconnected architectural layers, each addressing a critical aspect of emotionally intelligent AI systems:

### 1. Physix Transitional Layer

*Physix* is an intentional term in this project, denoting the phenomenological "physics" that governs how lived experience is transformed into structured symbolic representations.
**Purpose:** Translate lived experience into structured symbolic meaning.

**Functions:**
- Experience → Structure → Meaning transformation
- Emotional grammar parsing
- Metaphor bridging
- Identity modeling

**Artifacts:**
- MeTTa schemas
- Y0X1 tag sets

### 2. Anshar–Hyperon Pipeline

**Purpose:** Neuro-symbolic stack for deep emotional comprehension.

**Functions:**
- IoNation frequency mapping
- Y0X1 qualia tagging
- MeTTa semantics processing
- TQNN (Temporal Qualia Neural Network) memory
- Hyperon reasoning engine

**Artifacts:**
- JSON orchestration files
- Curated emotional case dataset

### 3. DAC Governance Layer

**Purpose:** Decentralized, emotionally intelligent community governance.

**Functions:**
- Collective intelligence coordination
- Health-driven control mechanisms
- Tokenomics management
- Restorative mechanisms

**Artifacts:**
- Smart contracts
- Governance dashboards

### 4. Scaling BASI Roadmap

**Purpose:** Ensure scalable, efficient, and safe operation.

**Functions:**
- Clarity (Cₕ) metrics
- Decoupling (D) strategies
- Resonance (ρ) measurement
- Efficiency envelope constraints

**Artifacts:**
- Formal metrics
- Verification plots

### 5. Identity Continuity Layer

**Purpose:** Maintain longitudinal coherence of identity.

**Functions:**
- IoNation lattice construction
- Temporal tracking
- Cross-session memory integration

**Artifacts:**
- Identity grammars
- Privacy-preserving schemas

### 6. Ethical Oversight Layer

**Purpose:** Embed moral technologies across all layers.

**Functions:**
- Generator functions for ethical constraints
- Rights of Being/Sapience implementation
- Anti-capture mechanisms

**Artifacts:**
- Smart contract clauses
- Impact metrics

## AI Governance & Ethical Licensing

This project is committed to ethical AI development and environmental sustainability through the **BGINEXUS.io AI Commons Licensing Framework**. We incorporate six governance logics for impact-oriented AI licensing:

### The Six AI Governance Commons (BGINEXUS.io)

1. **[Value Commons](LICENSES/VALUE-COMMONS.md)** - Share automation gains with workers, communities, and shared infrastructures
2. **[Transparency Commons](LICENSES/TRANSPARENCY-COMMONS.md)** - Standardize evidence of AI behavior and impacts through reusable documentation
3. **[Sustainability Commons](LICENSES/SUSTAINABILITY-COMMONS.md)** - Embed ecological accounting, energy measurement, and resource constraints
4. **[Access Commons](LICENSES/ACCESS-COMMONS.md)** - Enable meaningful use by public-interest actors, researchers, and underserved communities
5. **[Reciprocity Commons](LICENSES/RECIPROCITY-COMMONS.md)** - Recognize and reward contributions from data creators, annotators, and infrastructure providers
6. **[Governance Commons](LICENSES/GOVERNANCE-COMMONS.md)** - Create multi-stakeholder oversight with real authority over AI systems

These licenses can be adopted **individually or in combination** to operationalize neurodivergent-centered and biocentric values in AI licensing agreements.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file and [LICENSES/](LICENSES/) directory for detailed information.
