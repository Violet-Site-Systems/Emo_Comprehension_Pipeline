## Key Principles

1. **Distributed-First**: Design for distribution from the start
2. **Autonomous Operation**: Minimize human intervention
3. **Ethical Alignment**: Maintain alignment at all scales
4. **Neurodivergent-Centered**: Respect diverse cognitive patterns
5. **Biocentric Values**: Consider all forms of life

## Success Metrics

- Latency: < 100ms cross-node communication
- Availability: > 99.9% uptime
- Scalability: Linear scaling to 1000+ nodes
- Autonomy: > 95% autonomous decision-making

## Risk Mitigation

- Regular alignment audits
- Distributed governance mechanisms
- Failsafe protocols
- Community oversight

## Community Involvement

- Open development process
- Regular community updates
- Transparent decision-making
- Multi-stakeholder governance
