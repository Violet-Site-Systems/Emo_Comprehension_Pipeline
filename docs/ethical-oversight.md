## Decision-Making Framework

### Ethical Decision Process

1. **Identify Decision**: What needs to be decided?
2. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Who is affected?
3. **Value Assessment**: Which principles apply?
4. **Impact Evaluation**: What are the consequences?
5. **Alternatives**: What other options exist?
6. **Consultation**: Engage affected parties
7. **Decision**: Make informed choice
8. **Documentation**: Record rationale
9. **Communication**: Share transparently
10. **Monitor**: Track outcomes and adjust

### Conflict Resolution

When ethical principles conflict:

1. **Prioritize harm prevention**: Do no harm comes first
2. **Consult stakeholders**: Seek input from affected parties
3. **Seek least harmful path**: Minimize negative impacts
4. **Document reasoning**: Explain trade-offs
5. **Review decision**: Plan for retrospective analysis

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

**Technical Risks**

**Continuous Improvement**
- Learning from incidents
- Community feedback integration
- Best practice adoption
- Regular training and education

## Incident Response

### Response Protocol

1. **Detection**: Identify ethical concern
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further harm
4. **Investigation**: Understand root cause
5. **Resolution**: Implement fix or mitigation
6. **Communication**: Inform stakeholders
7. **Documentation**: Record incident and response
8. **Review**: Learn and improve

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate harm to beings or severe misalignment
