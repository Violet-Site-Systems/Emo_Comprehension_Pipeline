# Y0x1 Module

## Overview

The Y0x1 module provides the foundational layer for the Emotional Comprehension Pipeline. It establishes the base architecture and core functionality upon which other components build.

## Purpose

Y0x1 serves as:
- Foundation layer for emotional processing
- Base data structures and interfaces
- Core utility functions
- System initialization and configuration

## Components (Coming Soon)

- Base emotional state representations
- Core processing interfaces
- Utility functions and helpers
- Configuration management
- Logging and monitoring foundations

## Integration

Y0x1 integrates with:
- **Ionation**: Provides base structures for neural processing
- **MeTTa**: Supplies foundation for symbolic reasoning
- **TQNN**: Establishes temporal processing primitives
- **Hyperon**: Offers base reasoning infrastructure

## Development Status

🚧 Under development - Initial architecture planning phase

## Contributing

When contributing to Y0x1:
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Follow established design patterns
- Consider impact on dependent modules
- Include appropriate tests
- Align with ethical guidelines
