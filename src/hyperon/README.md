# Hyperon Module

## Overview

The Hyperon module integrates the OpenCog Hyperon framework for advanced reasoning, planning, and meta-level cognition in the Emotional Comprehension Pipeline. It provides the highest level of cognitive processing and system-level reasoning.

## Purpose

Hyperon enables:
- Advanced multi-paradigm reasoning
- Meta-level cognition and reflection
- Complex planning and goal management
- System-wide coordination
- Emergent cognitive capabilities

## OpenCog Hyperon Integration

Hyperon is built on the OpenCog Hyperon framework, which provides:

- **AtomSpace**: Hypergraph knowledge representation
- **MeTTa**: Meta-type talk language for reasoning
- **MOSES**: Meta-optimizing semantic evolutionary search
- **PLN**: Probabilistic logic networks
- **Attention Allocation**: Dynamic resource management

### Key Capabilities

1. **Multi-Paradigm Reasoning**
   - Logical reasoning (PLN)
   - Evolutionary learning (MOSES)
   - Neural-symbolic integration
   - Probabilistic inference

2. **Meta-Cognition**
   - Reasoning about reasoning
   - Self-reflection and adaptation
   - Strategy selection
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Advanced Planning**
   - Goal-directed behavior
   - Multi-step reasoning
   - Context-aware strategy selection
   - Adaptive plan refinement

## Architecture Integration

### System Coordination

Hyperon serves as the cognitive coordinator, integrating:

- **Y0x1**: Foundation layer data
- **Ionation**: Neural processing outputs
- **MeTTa**: Symbolic reasoning results
- **TQNN**: Temporal dynamics

### Cognitive Flow

```
Input → Perception → Understanding → Reasoning → Planning → Response

metta = MeTTa(atomspace)

# Emotional reasoning
emotional_context = """
(: context Context
    (emotional-state anxious)
    (situation social-interaction)
    (history (recent-event stressful-meeting)))

(: query (appropriate-response context))
"""

result = metta.eval(emotional_context)
```
